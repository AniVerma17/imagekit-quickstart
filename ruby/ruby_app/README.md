# Ruby plain application

This is a sample to show you how to integrate ImageKit in the plain Ruby application.

## Setting up ImageKit Ruby SDK

Open `app.rb` it and add your public and private API keys, as well as the URL endpoint as follows. You can get these parameters from the developer section in your ImageKit dashboard - https://imagekit.io/dashboard#developers

```ruby
public_key = 'your_public_key'
private_key = 'your_private_key'
url_endpoint = 'your_url_endpoint' # https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id/
```

Then run the application using:
```bash
ruby app.rb
```

All the outputs will rendered on the terminal.
